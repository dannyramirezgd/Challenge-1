# Code Refactor Starter Code

I replaced all the div and other non semantic labels with more approripate HTML Semantic labels.
I changed the CSS selects to match the new semantic elements.
I added accessibility options for images by including alt info and describing the images.
I ensured all navigation links worked correctly.
I eliminated extra code within the CSS style sheet and the HTML page.
