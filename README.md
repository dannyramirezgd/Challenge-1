# Code Refactor Starter Code
I replaced all the div and other non semantic labels with more approripate HTML Semantic labels. 
I changed the CSS selects to match the new semantic elements. 
I added accessibility options for images by including alt info and describing the images. 
I ensured all navigation links worked correctly. 
I eliminated extra code within the CSS style sheet and the HTML page.
